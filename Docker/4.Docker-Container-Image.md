Note:- We can’t remove any docker image forcefully if that image runs any container, if we try to remove forcefully, then it will only be untagged but will not remove, to remove any docker image first we should make sure that no container is running with that particular image and if any container is running then first we need to remove the container in order to remove the images, once the container gets deleted then we can easily remove the docker image by using the command, “docker rmi image_name”

If we create any container and the image of that container if don’t exists in the host server then first docker will pull that image from docker hub and then will proceed to create the container, and if we don’t mention the version of any image we pull then docker by default will always pull the latest image.

Here I created the container then the default command bash is taken, and I came out of container with using command ctel+p+q so the container didn’t die after coming out.

To enter into the running container, we use the exec command with option -it is must also we need to run any command either bash or any command to enter into container.

Here the thing to notice is that inside container vi command is not working, means any container contains the only package which is required by them to initialize the specific work, if we need other command or file we can install it via yum.

If we want to search the image of any file exist or not in docker hub and with what name do their official images exist, we can use the search command to do so: -

Here we ran a container tomcat, so as the images was not existing there so first docker pulled the images from docker hub and then run it, but the important thing to note here is tomcat default port is 8080 but we need to do port mapping before running any such applications which uses any specific ports, because we know that docker runs on top of host machine, so the default ports remains reserved for host machine, so if we try to run the IP address in browser with 8080 port we will get the error , to get the tomcat up in our container we must need to do port mapping.
2nd important thing to note here is that if we haven’t run this container with any specific command then docker runs its default command “catalins.sh run” which is mandatory to install the tomcat, the path of Catalina has been shown in next image.

See in below image I had used bash command to run tomcat container, so catalins.sh is not run, so if we will move inside this container and look for the tomcat server we will find that tomcat service is not running while in pervious container/pic if we will move inside container we will find that tomcat service is running fine.

Here I am doing port mapping too, so once the tomcat container will be created automatically one random free IP will be assigned to tomcat service of the container, as we had used -P , however by using small p, we can also assign the IP of our wish to the container which has been shown below

Here we have mapped the ip to 1234 port
