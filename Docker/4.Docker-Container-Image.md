### Restarting the container

    docker restart b6e96635bb7c

### Pause the container 

    docker pause b6e96635bb7c

 ### unpause the container
 
    docker unpause b6e96635bb7c
    
### Rename your container Name

    docker rename b6e96635bb7c Devops_G

 ### Stop your container
 
    docker stop b6e96635bb7c
    
   <img src="/Docker/Images/20.jpg" alt="Docker Directory" width="816" height="100"> 
   
 ### Start your container
  
    docker start b6e96635bb7c
    
  <img src="/Docker/Images/21.jpg" alt="Docker Directory" width="816" height="100"> 
  
  ### Delete the container
  
      docker rm b6e96635bb7c
      
   <img src="/Docker/Images/22.jpg" alt="Docker Directory" width="816" height="200">     
  
Note: We can’t delete a container which is in start state, so either 1st we need to stop the running container and then remove it or by using -f command we can remove the container forcefully.
  
    docker stop b6e96635bb7c
    
    
 ###  Delete the container
    
    docker rm b6e96635bb7c
   
  
### Validate that the container is deleted successfully
   
      docker ps -a
      
      And also validate container doesn’t exist in /var/lib/docker/containers

   Force delete of a container when container is running
   
      docker rm -f b6e96635bb7c
      
  ### We can also delete multiple stopped container or running container in a while by using the command “docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)” , the concept of this command is that “docker rm -f container_id” command we uses to delete the container forcefully and to get a list of container id we uses the command “docker ps -a -q” , so combining two we can remove all container in a while.

** Image is immutable, we can’t modify any images, but we can make changes in container and can save the container as new images.
** Whenever we run a container it must should have any process running it inside, if no process runs inside it then container will die.
** If we ever run any OS in only -d (detached mode) then immediately that container will die as no OS can run in background/detached mode as no process runs inside a OS container in detached mode, however we can run other container in detached mode who will have process inside
        
        docker run -itd ubuntu


### docker run –rm -d -P tomcat
this command will remove/delete the container immediately whenever the containers stops.
